This project is made by Chen Ji Rong "Jack" Jiang in collaboration with the [BasakLab](https://basaklab.com/). Special thanks to Professor [Onur Basak](https://www.linkedin.com/in/onur-basak-a2b96468). This project is still in progress...

## About

The project aims to provide a unified atlas of the adult human midbrain atlases. In order to achieve this goal, a computational pipeline that will facilitate the integration of atlases various midbrain areas will be established. This repository contains scripts and notebooks used in this project.
